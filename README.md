# VizPsyche

VizPsyche is an open-source 3D graphics engine written in C++20 using OpenGL 4.6. Designed for learning graphics programming, it provides clean abstractions over OpenGL primitives and includes an ImGui-based interface for real-time parameter editing.

## Documentation

The full documentation for VizPsyche is available as a submodule in `docs/vis-psyche-docs`. To clone it separately:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:DiggingNebula8/vis-psyche-docs.git
```

---

## Features

- Modern C++ & OpenGL 4.6 rendering pipeline
- Abstraction classes: VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer, VertexArray, Shader, Texture, Renderer
- glTF 2.0 Model Loading
- Texture Support
- Unified shader format (vertex and fragment shaders in a single file)
- ImGui integration for runtime parameter adjustment
- spdlog-based logging with separate core and client loggers
- Engine/Application architecture for creating custom applications

---


## Prerequisites

### Windows

1. **Visual Studio 2019, 2022, or 2026** with the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed.

2. **CMake 3.16 or later**. Either use the version bundled with Visual Studio, or download from https://cmake.org/download/.

3. **Git** for cloning the repository with submodules.

---

## Building

### Option 1: Build Script (Recommended)

Open a terminal in the repository root and run:

```
.\build.bat debug
.\build.bat release
.\build.bat clean debug
.\build.bat clean release
```

The script automatically detects your installed Visual Studio version.

### Option 2: Manual CMake

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
cmake --build . --config Debug
```

Replace "Visual Studio 17 2022" with your installed version:
- Visual Studio 2019: `"Visual Studio 16 2019"`
- Visual Studio 2022: `"Visual Studio 17 2022"`
- Visual Studio 2026: `"Visual Studio 18 2026"`

### Option 3: Open in Visual Studio

After running CMake, open the generated solution:

```
cmake --open build
```

Or directly open `build\VizPsyche.sln`.

---

## Running

After a successful build, the output is located in:

```
build\bin\Debug\Sandbox.exe
build\bin\Debug\VizEngine.dll
build\bin\Debug\src\resources\
```

Run the application:

```
.\build\bin\Debug\Sandbox.exe
```

For release builds, replace `Debug` with `Release`.

---

## Knowledge Graph

The project maintains a unified knowledge graph (`graphify-out/`) linking engine source and documentation together. It tracks which classes have doc coverage, surfaces coverage gaps, and maps relationships between code and chapters.

```
graphify-out/
  graph.json        # committed — 1016 nodes (code + doc + images), 1428 edges
  GRAPH_REPORT.md   # committed — community summary, god nodes, coverage gaps
  graph.html        # generated — interactive visualization (gitignored)
  wiki/             # generated — agent-crawlable wiki (gitignored)
  obsidian/         # generated — Obsidian vault (gitignored)
```

### Setup after cloning

```bash
pip install graphifyy
graphify install
python graphify_rebuild.py
```

- `pip install graphifyy` — installs the graphify Python package
- `graphify install` — installs the `/graphify` skill into Claude Code
- `python graphify_rebuild.py` — regenerates wiki, Obsidian vault, HTML and report from the committed `graph.json` (no LLM calls needed)

### Updating the graph

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Source files changed (no new classes) | `python graphify_rebuild.py` |
| New class added to source | Ask Claude Code for semantic extraction, then `python graphify_update_docs.py` |
| New or revised chapter | Doc extraction (via Claude Code), then `python graphify_update_docs.py` |
| Community labels missing | `python graphify_rebuild.py` |

> **Note:** Never run the `/graphify` skill directly on any path — it rebuilds `graph.json` from scratch using only what it detects, destroying semantic nodes that span multiple directories. Always use the scripts above.

---

## Dependencies

All dependencies are included as git submodules in `VizEngine/vendor/`.

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| GLFW 3.3+ | Window creation and input handling |
| GLAD | OpenGL 4.6 function loader |
| GLM | Mathematics library (vectors, matrices, transformations) |
| Dear ImGui | Immediate mode graphical user interface |
| spdlog | Fast C++ logging library |
| stb_image | Single-header image loading |
| tinygltf | glTF 2.0 Model Loading |

To update submodules manually:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find any instance of Visual Studio"

CMake cannot locate Visual Studio. Verify that:
- Visual Studio is installed with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
- You are using a supported version (2019, 2022, or 2026)

### Submodule directories are empty

Run:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Missing DLL error when running Sandbox.exe

Ensure you are running from the correct directory (`build\bin\Debug\` or `build\bin\Release\`). The build places `VizEngine.dll` alongside `Sandbox.exe`.

### OpenGL errors or black screen

- Update your GPU drivers
- Verify your GPU supports OpenGL 4.6
- Check the console output for shader compilation errors

### Linker errors (unresolved external symbols)

- Clean the build directory and rebuild: `.\build.bat clean debug`
- Verify all source files are listed in `VizEngine/CMakeLists.txt`
